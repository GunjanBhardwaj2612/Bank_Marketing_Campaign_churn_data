**Objective : Analyse the patterns and provide inferences/solutions for the future marketing campaign.**


The bank conducted a telemarketing campaign for one of its financial products ‘Term Deposits’ to help foster long-term relationships with existing customers. The dataset contains information about all the customers who were contacted during a particular year to open term deposit accounts.

What is the term Deposit?

Term deposits also called fixed deposits, are the cash investments made for a specific time period ranging from 1 month to 5 years for predetermined fixed interest rates. The fixed interest rates offered for term deposits are higher than the regular interest rates for savings accounts. The customers receive the total amount (investment plus the interest) at the end of the maturity period. Also, the money can only be withdrawn at the end of the maturity period. Withdrawing money before that will result in an added penalty associated, and the customer will not receive any interest returns.

Target is to infer knowledge that where bank has to put more effort to improve it's positive response rate.
